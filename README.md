## Roadmap

- [ ] Increase the size of the heading itself and right align the docs link
- [ ] Auto select any new component that was just dragged into the art board
- [ ] Add simple prebuilt templates for the most commonly built component layouts for apps
- [ ] Let the user cycle through the components using their up / down arrows
